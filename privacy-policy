**Privacy Policy for Quiz or Not on the Google Assistant**

The content for Quiz or Not has been developed by [Viplove Prakash link](http://viploveprakash.com/). However, Quiz or Not runs on systems provided by Google, and Viplove Prakash does not have full access to the app. In particular, Viplove Prakash has no ability to access the messages you send to Quiz or Not or the responses that it sends back to you.

Viplove Prakash may receive from Google non-personally identifying information about the use of Quiz or Not. For instance, Viplove Prakash can access usage information regarding how many users are using the app, which geographical regions they are located in, and basic data including users’ language, device type, and length and frequency of use. None of the information Viplove Prakash receives from Google identifies you, nor does it reveal to Viplove Prakash what information you sent to the app or what specific responses the app sent to you.

When you use Quiz or Not, you are also using the Google Assistant, and the [Google Privacy Policy link](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) describes how Google collects and uses data about your use of the app. You may wish to consult Google’s documentation regarding [what information is shared with your Google Assistant link](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7126196) and [how to delete your Google Assistant activity link](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7108295).

Viplove Prakash may, in the future, modify Quiz or Not to run on infrastructure which Viplove Prakash has full access to, which would allow Viplove Prakash access to additional information about your interaction with the app. Should that occur, Viplove Prakash will comply with its obligations under applicable privacy law, including updating this Privacy Policy as required.
